# Asset Attributions

This project uses (or plans to use) the following third‑party art / audio assets. Placeholder entries will be updated as real assets are added.

## LPC (Liberated Pixel Cup) Character Sprites
- Source: https://lpc.opengameart.org/ (aggregate) / Example base: https://opengameart.org/content/liberated-pixel-cup-base-assets
- License: CC-BY-SA 3.0 (and/or GPL 3.0 per specific sheets; we standardize on CC-BY-SA 3.0 where available)
- Authors (core base set): Redshrike, Michael Whitlock (AKA Yamatoya), Stephen Challener (AKA Redshrike), Jordan Irwin (AntumDeluge), William.Thompsonj, Lanea Zimmerman (AKA Sharm), Benjamin K. Smith, Charles Sanchez (Bluecarrot16), and other LPC contributors.
- Modifications: Scaled / trimmed into 64x64 frame grid, palette adjustments TBD.
- Requirement: Must distribute derivative sprite sheets under the same CC-BY-SA 3.0 license and provide attribution to original authors above.

## Kenney Assets (Icons / FX / UI)
- Source: https://kenney.nl/
- License: CC0 1.0 Universal
- Planned Packs: "Kenney RPG Urban / Platformer", "Kenney UI Pack", "Kenney Effects" (exact pack names TBD)
- Authors: Kenney.nl
- Modifications: Packing into texture atlas / color tinting / scaling.

## Internal Generated Placeholders
- Procedural 4x4 color animation previously used for player placeholder (to be deprecated). Generated at runtime – no external license required.

## Usage Guidelines
1. Keep this file updated whenever we add or replace an external sheet or atlas.
2. For LPC additions: list specific OpenGameArt links + authors if different from base set.
3. For Kenney: grouping by pack is sufficient (CC0) but still credit out of courtesy.
4. Do not remove existing author names when adding modifications.
5. For any audio additions, create a new section with links & licenses.
