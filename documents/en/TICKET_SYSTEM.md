## Prometheus Metrics

The ticket system integrates with Prometheus metrics:

### Metrics Exposed

1. **tickets_created_total** - Total tickets created
   - Labels: `category`, `priority`

2. **tickets_open** - Current open tickets (gauge)

3. **ticket_responses_total** - Total ticket responses
   - Labels: `is_staff` (true/false)

4. **tickets_resolved_total** - Total tickets resolved
   - Labels: `category`

5. **tickets_closed_total** - Total tickets closed
   - Labels: `category`

### Example Queries

```promql
# Open tickets
tickets_open

# Ticket creation rate (last 5 minutes)
rate(tickets_created_total[5m])

# Resolution rate by category
rate(tickets_resolved_total[5m])

# Average resolution time (calculated from stats endpoint)
# Use /tickets/stats API for this metric
```

## Ticket Workflow

### Standard Flow

1. **Player creates ticket** → Status: `open`
2. **Staff assigns ticket** → Status: `in_progress`
3. **Staff investigates and responds** → Status: `in_progress`
4. **Issue resolved** → Status: `resolved`
5. **Player confirms or auto-close** → Status: `closed`

### Priority Handling

Tickets are sorted by:
1. **Priority** (urgent → high → normal → low)
2. **Age** (older tickets first within same priority)

### Auto-Management

The system tracks:
- Average resolution time
- Oldest open ticket
- Staff workload (assigned tickets)
- Response times

## Integration

### With GM Backend

Tickets integrate with the GM backend for:
- Staff authentication
- Permission checking
- Action logging

### With Analytics

Ticket metrics feed into the analytics dashboard for:
- Support efficiency tracking
- Common issue identification
- Staff performance monitoring

## Default FAQs

The system includes 4 default FAQs:
1. Password reset instructions

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Email notifications for ticket updates
- Ticket escalation rules
- SLA (Service Level Agreement) tracking
